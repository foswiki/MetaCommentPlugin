This is YACS (yet another comment system) which tries 

   * (a) to be easy to use 
   * (b) to scale up to lots of comments
   * (c) to provide different layouts and commenting requirements

<nop>%TOPIC% allows to easily add commenting to any topic. Discussiosn can
either be displayed in linear or threaded mode. Different comment styles and
layouts can easily be created and switched from one to the other.  Comments can
be edited and deleted inline easily.  Commenting can be enabled independently
from the normal change access rights to a topic while they are still stored as
meta data to a topic. That way a keyword search matching on different comments
of the same discussion will generate a hit on the discussion itself in a
natural way.

Note, that this plugin is in alpha state as some features are still missing:

   * implement an approval system
   * implement a RECENTCOMMENTS macro to display a list of all activities in a forum
   * extend METACOMMENTS to display/suppress comments that are approved/need approvement
